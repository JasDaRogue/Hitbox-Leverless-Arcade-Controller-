# Hitbox-Leverless-Arcade-Controller

This is a personal diy project. A Hitbox Leverless Arcade Controller is a controller specifically made for fighting video games like Tekken and Street Fighter. The term leverless comes from the fact that unlike a normal arcade stick which utilizes
an arcade stick for movement, a lever controller uses buttons.
